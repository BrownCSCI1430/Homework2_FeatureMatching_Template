    (Please note that we recommend implementing this function last and using cheat_feature_points()
    to test your implementation of get_feature_descriptors() and match_features())

    Implement the Harris corner detector (See Szeliski 7.1.1) to start with.
    You do not need to worry about scale invariance or keypoint orientation estimation
    for your Harris corner detector.
    You can create additional feature point detector functions (e.g. MSER)
    for extra credit.

    If you're finding spurious (false/fake) feature point detections near the boundaries,
    it is safe to simply suppress the gradients / corners near the edges of
    the image.

    Useful functions: A working solution does not require the use of all of these
    functions, but depending on your implementation, you may find some useful. Please
    reference the documentation for each function/library and feel free to come to hours
    or post on EdStem with any questions

def get_feature_descriptors(image, x_array, y_array, window_width, mode):
    '''
    Returns features for a given set of feature points.

    To start with, normalize patches as your local feature descriptor. You will 
    then need to implement the more effective SIFT-like feature descriptor.
    (See Szeliski 7.1.2 or the original publications at
    http://www.cs.ubc.ca/~lowe/keypoints/)

    Your implementation does not need to exactly match the SIFT reference.
    Here are the key properties your (baseline) feature descriptor should have:
    (1) a 4x4 grid of cells, each feature_width / 4 pixels square.
    (2) each cell should have a histogram of the local distribution of
        gradients in 8 orientations. Appending these histograms together will
        give you 4x4 x 8 = 128 dimensions.
    (3) Each feature should be normalized to unit length

    You do not need to perform the interpolation in which each gradient
    measurement contributes to multiple orientation bins in multiple cells
    As described in Szeliski, a single gradient measurement creates a
    weighted contribution to the 4 nearest cells and the 2 nearest
    orientation bins within each cell, for 8 total contributions. This type
    of interpolation probably will help, though.

    You do not have to explicitly compute the gradient orientation at each
    pixel (although you are free to do so). You can instead filter with
    oriented filters (e.g. a filter that responds to edges with a specific
    orientation). All of your SIFT-like features can be constructed entirely
    from filtering fairly quickly in this way.

    You do not need to do the normalize -> threshold -> normalize again
    operation as detailed in Szeliski and the SIFT paper. It can help, though.

    Another simple trick which can help is to raise each element of the final
    feature vector to some power that is less than one.

    Useful functions: A working solution does not require the use of all of these
    functions, but depending on your implementation, you may find some useful. Please
    reference the documentation for each function/library and feel free to come to hours
    or post on EdStem with any questions

        - skimage.filters (library)


    :params:
    :image: a grayscale or color image (your choice depending on your implementation)
    :x: np array of x coordinates (column indices) of feature points
    :y: np array of y coordinates (row indices) of feature points
    :window_width: in pixels, is the local window width. You can assume
                    that window_width will be a multiple of 4 (i.e. every cell of your
                    local SIFT-like feature will have an integer width and height).
    :mode: either "patch" or "sift". Switches between image patch descriptors
           and SIFT descriptors

    If you want to detect and describe features at multiple scales or
    particular orientations you can add input arguments. Make sure input arguments 
    are optional or the autograder will break.

    :returns:
    :features: np array of computed features. features[i] is the descriptor for 
               point (x[i], y[i]), so the shape of features should be 
               (len(x), feature dimensionality). For standard SIFT, `feature
               dimensionality` is 128. `num points` may be less than len(x) if
               some points are rejected, e.g., if out of bounds.

    # IMAGE PATCH STEPS
    # STEP 1: For each feature point, cut out a window_width x window_width patch 
    #         of the image (as you will in SIFT)
    # STEP 2: Flatten this image patch into a 1-dimensional vector (hint: np.flatten())
    
    # SIFT STEPS
    # STEP 1: Calculate the gradient (partial derivatives on two directions) on all pixels.
    # STEP 2: Decompose the gradient vectors to magnitude and direction.
    # STEP 3: For each feature point, calculate the local histogram based on related 4x4 grid cells.
    #         Each cell is a square with feature_width / 4 pixels length of side.
    #         For each cell, we assign these gradient vectors corresponding to these pixels to 8 bins
    #         based on the direction (angle) of the gradient vectors. 
    # STEP 4: Now for each cell, we have a 8-dimensional vector. Appending the vectors in the 4x4 cells,
    #         we have a 128-dimensional feature.
    # STEP 5: Don't forget to normalize your feature.

    # BONUS: There are some ways to improve:
    # 1. Use a multi-scaled feature descriptor.
    # 2. Borrow ideas from GLOH or other type of feature descriptors.

def match_features(im1_features, im2_features):
    '''
    Matches feature descriptors of one image with their nearest neighbor in the other. 
    Implements the Nearest Neighbor Distance Ratio (NNDR) Test to help threshold
    and remove false matches.

    Please implement the "Nearest Neighbor Distance Ratio (NNDR) Test" ,
    Equation 7.18 in Section 7.1.3 of Szeliski.

    For extra credit you can implement spatial verification of matches.

    Remember that the NNDR will return a number close to 1 for feature 
    points with similar distances. Think about how you might want to threshold
    this ratio (hint: see lecture slides for NNDR)

    This function does not need to be symmetric (e.g., it can produce
    different numbers of matches depending on the order of the arguments).

    A match is between a feature in im1_features and a feature in im2_features. We can
    represent this match as a the index of the feature in im1_features and the index
    of the feature in im2_features
